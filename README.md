## Spotify Streamer

Projects 1 & 2 from the [Udacity Android Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801).

It's a simple application that uses [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) and allows you to search for your favorite artists. Once found you can play a short, 30-second version of the most popular songs for the artist.

The app works well on both phones and tablets and it also provides a way to share content.
